### 7) Programs used in work development work flow
#### IDEs
- integrated development environment
- IDEs are applications which are being used to write code, compile or interpret code, debug and test code
- for example:
	- **VS Code**
		- its lightweight and easy to use application
		- it has a lots extensions and addons which you can use to customize your editor
	- **Cursor**
		- its a fork of VS Code, but it uses AI
		- AI helps you write code and debug it
		- also can help you understand big, complicated code by making comments where its gonna explain what the code does
	- **PhpStorm**
		- its powerful IDE specifically designed for PHP development
		- provides advanced code completion, refactoring tools, and debugging tailored for PHP
		- it also have excellent support for various PHP frameworks
	- **RustRover**
		- thats special editor made just for coding in Rust
		- helps you find problems, fix them, and test your Rust code
		- also helps you manage Rust's tricky rules about how code uses memory
#### Debugging
- next thing I already mention is debugging
- debugging is a process of finding and fixing errors or bugs in source code
- its being used when software, application or website doesnt work as expected, thats when debugger comes in
- for example:
	- **Chrome Developer Tools**
		- its available in chrome browser and other chromium based browsers
		- it lets you look at the HTML, CSS and JavaScript code of the website
	- **Xcode Debugger**
		- its debugged for making apps for iPhone and Macs
		- helps you fix code written in Swift and Objective-C
		- it also helps you find memory problems and make your apps run faster
	- **Xdebug**
		- tool that helps you debug PHP code
		- lets you stop your code, step through it and look the code is really doing like setting variables, changing values and much more
### 18) What programming languages do you know?
- I would like to start with that I know a lot of programming languages, but at school we only learn Assembly, C++ and PHP
- but they are many many more than just these and theyre divided into categories like **Web Development**, **System Programming**, **Mobile App Development**, **Game Development**, **Data science & AI** and **Databases**
- now I will say couple of languages for each category

- **Web** **Development**
	- JavaScript
	- TypeScript
	- PHP
	- Ruby
	- Dart
	- HTML and CSS (not programming language, but markup language)
- **System** **Programming**
	- C
	- Objective-C
	- C++
	- Rust
	- Go
	- Assembly
- **Mobile** **App** **Development**
	- Swift (for iOS)
	- Kotlin (for Android)
	- Java (for Android)
	- Dart (which is Flutter framework)
- **Game** **Development**
	- C++ and C# (both used for Unity engine)
	- Lua (for Roblox)
	- Pawn (for game modding)
- **Data** **science** **& AI**
	- Python
	- R
	- Julia
	- MATLAB
- **Databases**
	- those are divided into multiple categories, but the most important are **Relation Databases** and **NoSQL Databases**
	- **Relation Databases**
		- MySQL
		- PostgreSQL
		- SQLite
		- MariaDB
	- **NoSQL Databases**
		- MongoDB
		- Redis
		- Cassandra
